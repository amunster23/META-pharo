## Pharo Download Instructions
For the first part of the course we will be using *Pharo 10.0 stable (64 bit)*.
In this document you can find instructions to download and run pharo with the PharoLauncher or through the command line.

### Windows & MacOs (& Linux)
You can download the PharoLauncher at https://pharo.org/download.
Make sure Pharo runs by creating an image (click on new button, top-left), under _Official Distributions_ select _Pharo 10.0 - 64bit (stable)_. Then set an image name, and click on create image.
The new image will show up in the main view, select it and then click on the green _Launch_ button. You should now see the Pharo UI!

### Linux & MacOs (CLI)
If you prefer, you can directly download pharo from the command line, by executing

```$ curl get.pharo.org/64/stable+vm | bash ```

Make sure Pharo runs by running

```$ ./pharo-ui Pharo.image ```

You should now see the Pharo UI.
